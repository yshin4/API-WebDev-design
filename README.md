**CMSI 370** Interaction Design, Fall 2016

# Assignment 1201
This assignment releases you from coding-related constraints and lets you try your hand at being a full-on, no-holds-barred interaction designer.

## Background Reading
Textbook reading is comprehensive for this assignment: anything may be relevant from throughout the semester.

## For Submission

### A “Dream” Interface Design
This is your chance to cut loose—design your idea of a “dream” user interface for a selected system. Think outside of the box, be creative, mix and match interaction styles—it’s your call. Some (minimal, I hope) ground rules:

- You may mix and match any existing _shipping_ technology (e.g., multitouch, speech, audio/ video, gesture, 3D, accelerometers, gyroscopes, GPS) regardless of current platform.
- Prototype or speculative technologies are off-limits (e.g., brain control, holograms, see-through displays, human-like vision or comprehension)—if something does exist but remains extremely bleeding-edge, provide one or more references to document its availability.

That’s pretty much it. All else is fair game. A [template for the design document](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi-courseware/ixd/blob/master/hw/dream-design/dream-design-template.md) is included with this repository, specifying the content that you are expected to provide.

### What System?
The target system for your user interface is a front end for any currently existing web service API—any API, not necessarily the same one for which you implemented a web front end in [Assignment 1027](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi370-fall2016/assignments/blob/master/web-front-end.md). Maybe the API you really wanted was too restrictive to use, or had too many constraints; with this assignment, you can try your hand at it. In any case, you are constrained to the data and capabilities provided by that API, but you may present, process, navigate, or interact with those services in any way that you like. You also don’t need to worry about security constraints or server-side complexities that specific APIs may have. Assume that those are taken care of. To expand on the functional possibilities of your front end, you may also combine multiple APIs, as long as all of these APIs are used as they currently exist.

For systems that offer not only web services but also “drop-in” widgets (e.g., Pinterest, Twitch, Twitter, etc.), you are allowed to redesign those widgets as you see fit, if those widgets play a role in your dream design. Stay within the data provided by those widgets, but you can re-layout, -present, or -organize the information any way you like.

Presumably, you will find something among these options that is to your liking and will keep you excited. If you have any qustions about your choice, don’t hesitate to run it by me.

### How to Turn It In
Commit your design document as a file called _dream-design.md_ in this repository. As can be seen from the filename, [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) should be used.

Alternatively, you may also document your design as one or more web pages. Consider building these with Jekyll so that you get templating, standardized layouts, etc.—feel free to use the [paradixm](https://github.com/dondi/paradixm) Jekyll configuration as a starting point (suggested but not required). Of course, you should still follow the [design document template](https://github.com/lmu-cmsi-courseware/ixd/blob/master/hw/dream-design/dream-design-template.md) for the content of these pages.
