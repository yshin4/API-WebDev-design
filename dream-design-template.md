# Dream Design Document Template
Copy this file to a new one called _dream-design.md_. Populate the sections as indicated. Illustrate your ideas as needed, with diagrams, screen mockups, etc. Don’t forget to cite references—this is still a piece of formal writing.

## Application Description
> A description of the application for which you have created the design, focusing on any particular usability issues that you’d like to address. There is no restriction on the platform of the application; you can make it whatever you want it to be.

### Web Service(s) Used
> Briefly list and describe the web service(s) that will support the functionality of your application. Don’t assume that the reader knows about the service(s) beforehand. Describe the functionality you intend to use, and list the API calls that will support your dream design. Feel free to provide web links to relevant online documentation.

## Top-Level Design/Layout
> Provide an overview of your user interface. Annotated mockups work very well here, with accompanying text describing, at a high level, the various components of your design.

## Usage Scenarios
> A usage scenario is a mini-story that highlights how a user would accomplish a certain task in your dream design. Provide at least two. Make sure to provide the following information per scenario: (a) the task that the user will perform, (b) the relevant user interface elements for performing this task, and (c) a brief narrative on how the user would perform this task with those user interface elements. Mock up, animate, or annotate your scenarios liberally.

### Usage Scenario 1
> Replace the title with an actual description of the scenario, e.g., “Adding a Song to a Playlist.”

### Usage Scenario 2
> Ditto with the title.

## Design Rationale
> State why your design is the way it is: relevant priorities, mental models, interaction design concepts, guidelines, principles, theories, etc. Cite relevant references as needed.

## Usability Metric Forecast
> If implemented then tested, what would be your design’s strong metrics? Weak metrics? Explain your choices.

## References
> Cite formally, as you would with any other research paper.
