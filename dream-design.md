# Dream Design Document - Yahoo Weather App
![Start Screen Mockup](/images/dd_start-screen.png)
![Display page Mockup](/images/dd_summary.png)

## Application Description
>This app is a mobile app and can be used by both touch and voice control. It uses Yahoo Weather API and has additional features that the user might want to use after being informed about the weather description they were looking for. The program can be triggered by Siri or other voice recognition systems imbedded in user's device. Some of the example keywords or triggers would be 'Open Yahoo Weathers', 'Tell me today's Weather', 'How cold is it today', or 'Is San Diego hot?'.

>Then the app opens up on the device and it would look like the mockup of the starting page(left). The layered circles in the center will vibrate or move as it answers user's question. If the user clicks the before button on the start page, he or she can make the app to repeat what it said before. Likewise, if the next button is pressed after one or more before button is pressed it informs the user about the information in forward-history. Users who are using voice control can simply say repeat or triggers similar to that and the app would repeat itself. It will also display what it said in text on the bottom for user's who are not using sound or people with disabilities regarding hearing.

>When the app is given a specific question, such as a place or a date, it will tell the user maximum and minimum temperature of that day at that place. If the user does not specify location or date, the app will answer with default data, weather on user's current location for that day. The unit for temperature and wind will differ depending on the location that the user is in and the user can easily ask the app to change the units interchangeably.

>When the user clicks on the icon with four squares, which represents display, it will show the weathers for seven days in list starting from today's weather (right). It will briefly display the day, date, and the maximum temperature. The user can scroll down for the rest of the days (and that is why mockup image only displays about five days). When the user clicks on one of the days, it will move onto another screen that has more specific information about that day's weather including: wind, atmosphere, sunset, astronomy, longitude, and etc. Location can be changed through the search bar located on the top side of the screen. By default, it will be set to current location that the user is in. There is a triangle pointing downwards within the search bar and when clicked, it displays places near by.

>The user also has access to additional information related to weather beyond temperature, such as latitude and longitude, sunset and sunrise time, and data on wind and atmosphere. Furthermore, the user can use the linked google map API to look at real time street-view and pictures of how the weather looks like outside for today. In addition to that, because the Yahoo API gives a brief text description of the weather, such as 'mostly cloudy' or 'sunny', when the users click the clothes icon the app can open up a browser searching images for 'warm outfits', 'summer fashion', and 'rainy weather looks'. This functionalities will allow the app to satisfy users who wanted to know today's weather to choose their outfit or wanted to know what the outside environment is like.

### Web Service(s) Used
>The web services used to support my application are the Yahoo Weather API and the Google Maps API. Yahoo Weather API gave me access to various information that forms the bases of my app. Such information may include: temperature in different units, wind data, atmosphere(humidity, visibility, and pressure), sunset and sunrise times, longitude and latitude and much more. In addition, Yahoo Weather API also provides current date and time when the weather is searched. More data that can be accessed through this API and how you can call it is described in the yahoo documentation which is linked below. Google Map API is a side function that allows the user to see pictures of the current weather for whichever location he or she searched. Details of Google Map API can be found in the link below as well.

## Top-Level Design/Layout
> Provide an overview of your user interface. Annotated mockups work very well here, with accompanying text describing, at a high level, the various components of your design.

#Annotated mockup#
>The start page contains a circle that changes its size as it spits out verbalized texts so it looks like it is talking. It has five icons that can be tapped below: left arrow, four squares, map, shirt, and right arrow. The arrow keys can be used for going back or ahead a step just like how you can go back and forth when using a browser. This is so that the users don't have to repeat the same action to get the information they already got earlier. The four squares are usually used for gallery in many devices, and the icon itself seems remind the users of divided sections. This is the display button for application, where the user can see the summary of the current week's weather in a list. Clicking the map button displays real-time pictures and a street-view of the location at current day and time. The shirt icon takes the user to a browser on user's device, searching up outfits and showing images of it, depending on the weather.

> For the display page where it has a summary of the week's weather, a search bar is located at the top of the screen. This is for setting location and the user may click the search bar to write locations themselves or click on the triangle to see locations nearby. The user can click on one of the sections or the days in the list to see more information. This new page will contain detailed data about the day the user clicked including wind, atmosphere, temperature by time, and etc. The user can scroll down to see more information here as well.

## Usage Scenarios

### Asking for today's outfit
> The user is (a) looking up an outfit appropriate for today's weather and she will use (b) the voice control to (c) call the Yahoo Weather app and trigger it to search 'cold day outfit' on the browser.

> The user wakes up a little late in the morning and she does not have time to worry about what to wear today. She simply activates her device by saying 'Ok Siri' or 'Ok Yahoo Weather' and asks what she wants to know: 'what should I wear today?'. While doing this, she can multitask and make her breakfast or pack her bag. This saves time and makes her morning routine efficient. The benefits of this is that she can work on something else instead of looking things up herself and waiting for it to load. Moreover, she gets to know what outfit would be the most appropriate for today's weather, since the search results will be based on that day's weather in short text (ex. partly cloudy, sunny, possible rain). In addition, the interface for this is simple as it can be, to just ask the app for the information needed. If done by hand manually instead of using the voice control, one can click the shirt icon and it will give he or she recommended clothes for that day by default.

### Looking up sunset time at the beach
>The user wants to know (a) the sunset time at a beach in a foreign country. He uses (b) the display icon, location search bar, and today's button in order to (c) select the day (today) and location (beach) and to see the details (sunset) of that day's weather.

> The user is on a family trip in a foreign country and wants to spend time on the beach that afternoon. He does not know what the whether is like in that country, nor when the sunset is. He opens Yahoo Weather app, and clicks on the display button (four square icon). Because he is looking for a more specific data than just the temperature of the day, he clicks on the first box, or a section with today's day and date. It has the whole week's weather summary with current day's information on the very top, so it will be easy for the user to find the box or button for today. When the user clicks today's div, which is the first from the top, he can get detailed information about today. He sets his location to the beach he wants to visit by typing the name of it on the search bar and scrolls down for the sunset time.

## Design Rationale
> State why your design is the way it is: relevant priorities, mental models, interaction design concepts, guidelines, principles, theories, etc. Cite relevant references as needed.

> According to World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s guidelines for accessibility, we are supposed to "provide a text equivalent for every non-text element". Following this guideline, my design of Yahoo Weather app displays a text of what the voice control is saying verbally. This not only helps with people with hearing disabilities, but also with people who are on devices with no sound or sound turned off. With Smith and Mosier's high-level goals for data display organization which mentions consistency of data display and efficient information assimilation by the user, I kept the display page for the week's weather summary simple and concise. The data is presented in a consistent and uniform way, where each division has day, date, and highest temperature for the day. It only has three information, three most popular and basic demanded information of the weather app, which makes it easy for the user to take in instead of having to look for the information they need. I also considered flexibility for user control of data display from the organization guideline and allowed users to switch back and forth between detailed and concise display of the data. When the user wants to know more details, they can click on the section equivalent to the day they want to see the weather for and it will display more specific weather data for the day. Similarly, using Smith and Mosier's input/data entry guideline, I decided to design the app so that user can easily change the location (flexibility for user's control of data entry), but is not required to fill it in the data (minimal input action by user) and have default values (current location, today's date).

> I tried to follow by Shneiderman's eight golden rules as well. My icons were in the same style (white and simple) and I tried to keep the style of the app consistent in general, such as using blue-gray color scheme. Because you don't have to speak the language to know the weather, the app has an universal usability and can appeal to majority of audience. The fact that the buttons, or the sections labeled with the day/date are big prevents errors. The arrows pointing backwards and forward (or left and right) permits easy reversal of actions as well. The icons for display, map, and clothes were chosen due to Nielsen's usability heuristics of speaking the user's language. Because map is associated with location, I thought it would be a good choice to use for showing images of selected location or having a street-view. In the same sense, I chose a shirt to represent an outfit search function.  

>As I was brainstorming for the app, I referred back to the Card, Moran, and Newell (GOMS) Model also known as the  keystroke-level theories. For my app, the goal is to acquire data for today's weather, either minimal or specific. Operators are either use the voice control and ask question to get the information needed or click buttons or icons on the screen. In order to get the data, methods or sub-steps such as clicking the display button to see the summary of current week's weathers is necessary. Selection terms would be additional features such as clicking the map or shirt icon, as well as clicking the section labeled a day to see more details about the day's weather.

## Usability Metric Forecast
> When this app is in use, efficiency, errors, and satisfaction would be its strong metrics. This is because for those users who want to have access to the weather while they are working on something else, they can use the voice recognition to multitask and continue working on their task. Moreover, it only takes a click or two to find about this week's weather, which is quite efficient. This is an important factor due to the fact that the users most likely does not want to spend time on looking up weather information everyday. It is hard to make a mistake since the icons are very distinct and represents its functionality pretty well. The buttons in the app are not small so the users are unlikely to make clicking/pressing errors. This counts in as part of efficiency as well since making it easier to not make errors means decreased time to access the information wanted. The voice control system and additional features it has: outfit search function and picture of the outdoor scene contributes greatly to user's satisfaction. Through these features the user can get what they want instead of having to take an extra step themselves, or googling and searching information they wanted after finding out about the weather.

> One of the weaker metrics is learnability, since the icons (display, map, outfit) can be unclear to the first time users. However, this is easy for users to adjust to once they try each functionality once or twice. Nothing is complicated so it is not difficult for the users to find out what each functions do. The solution for learnability ties into memorability, which is also one of weak metrics of the app, for the reason that the users would have to know what each icon does to acquire the power to use the app efficiently. However, there are at most five functions depending on how the user wants to use the app so memorizing would not be a big problem.

>Overall, the Yahoo Weather app has to be used once or twice to see the app's full coverage of features. The user might have to remember what each icon does, but once he or she gets used to the app, it makes their task more efficient and convenient conclusively.
